# OSC Front-end Engineer Technical Assessment

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in joining Open Study College (OSC)! This assessment is designed to showcase your front-end engineering skills in alignment with the technologies and challenges you'll encounter at OSC.

## The Brief

**Build a functional, responsive e-commerce product page with a persistent mini-basket using data from [https://mock.shop/](https://mock.shop/).**

### Key Features

1. **Product Page:**
   - Display product **image**, **title**, **description**, and **price**.
   - Include an **"Add to Basket"** button.

2. **Mini Basket:**
   - **Add products** to the mini basket.
   - **View mini basket** from any page (persistent across routes).
   - **Update quantity** of items in the basket.
   - **Remove items** from the basket.
   - **Display total basket value.**

3. **Navigation:**
   - Add a simple navigation bar to simulate a multi-page app (e.g., Home, Products, About).
   - Ensure the **mini-basket persists** across page navigation.

## User Stories

- *As an online customer, I want to add products to a mini basket so that I can proceed to purchase.*
- *As an online customer, I want to view my mini basket on any page so that I never lose track of my items.*
- *As an online customer, I want to update item quantities and remove items so that I have control over my basket.*
- *As an online customer, I want to see the total cost of my basket to understand my purchase summary.*

## Technical Requirements

- **Framework:** React (bonus points for using **Remix.run** or **Shopify Hydrogen**).
- **Language:** TypeScript.
- **Styling:** (S)CSS Modules or styled-components (Tailwind optional but acceptable).
- **State Management:** React Context, Zustand, Redux, or similar.
- **API Integration:** Fetch products from [mock.shop](https://mock.shop/).
- **Routing:** React Router (or built-in routing if using Remix).
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG best practices (ARIA roles, semantic HTML).
- **Testing:** Add at least **one unit test** and **one integration test** (Jest + React Testing Library recommended).
- **Performance:** Optimize for load speed and performance (lazy loading, code-splitting, etc.).

---

## Bonus Points For

- Implementing micro-interactions (e.g., animations for adding items to the cart).
- Deploying the app (e.g., **Netlify**, **Vercel**) and sharing the link.
- Clean, modular code architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- Implementing a basic CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions for running tests).

---

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Repository:** Upload your code to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or equivalent.
2. **README.md:** Include:
   - Project overview
   - Setup instructions
   - Technical decisions and reasoning
   - Potential improvements if given more time

## Assessment Criteria

1. **Code Quality:** Readable, modular, maintainable code with appropriate comments.
2. **Technical Competency:** Solid understanding of React, TypeScript, and API integrations.
3. **State Management:** Efficient handling of basket state and data flow.
4. **Accessibility & Performance:** Adherence to accessibility standards and performance optimizations.
5. **Testing:** Basic implementation of unit and integration tests.
6. **Problem Solving:** Clear technical decisions with well-documented trade-offs.
7. **Collaboration Readiness:** Clear commit history and well-documented code structure.
